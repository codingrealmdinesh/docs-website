Establishing a New Relic Service Catalog offers immense value but currently demands significant time and resource investments from users. The process involves detailed structuring of teams, user creation, assignments, and mapping of entity ownership, presenting a substantial barrier to entry. To mitigate this, we propose an automation solution that leverages data from external systems, such as GitHub, where team structures and associations are already managed. This integration aims to streamline the setup process, significantly reduce upfront efforts, and accelerate the adoption of New Relic's Service Catalog.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

Users need to ensure that they are logged in to their Github accounts. This needs to be the same github account in which they want to install the github app that New Relic will be providing during installation step.


## Set up the Github integration [#set-up-github]

Vist <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > + Integrations & Agents** > Github integration</DNT> tile and follow the below steps to complete the Github integration.

<Steps>
<Step>

## Service Catalog Details [#service-catalog-details]

In this installation step, we will be asked to enable/disable the Power Service catalog option. Power Service catalog provides the users the ability to import all the data related to Teams, Repositories, Pull Request, Pull Request Review and Deployment. 

Users can enable it for importing all the items mentioned in the Power Service Catalog. Disabling it, users will only be able to import basic information about the teams and repositories.
    </Step>

    <Step>

## Github Integration [#github-integration]

As a next step of installation, we need to click on the install button. Then we get redirected to the Github App installation page. This app is provided by New Relic to help fetch the user's github account related information. 

Once the installation is complete, we will see the result page which will dynamically list down the retrieved Github data related to teams, repos, pull requests and deployments. It will take some time to fetch the complete inforamtion, hence the page will keep refreshing after every 10 seconds till we have the power service catalog ready. 

The result obtained will look like the below: 

| Category | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Teams | List of teams within the GitHub organization |
| Repositories | List of repositories owned by the GitHub account |
| Pull Requests | List of open and closed pull requests |
| Deployments | List of deployment events  |

These list items will be clickable links that will open up new tabs with more information. For example in case of Teams, we will be able to open this tab [one.newrelic.com > Teams](https://one.newrelic.com/teams)
