Establishing a New Relic Service Catalog offers immense value but currently demands significant time and resource investments from users. The process involves detailed structuring of teams, user creation, assignments, and mapping of entity ownership, presenting a substantial barrier to entry. To mitigate this, we propose an automation solution that leverages data from external systems, such as GitHub, where team structures and associations are already managed. This integration aims to streamline the setup process, significantly reduce upfront efforts, and accelerate the adoption of New Relic's Service Catalog.
